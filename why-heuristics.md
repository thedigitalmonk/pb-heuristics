# Why heuristics?

Heuristics are defined as mental shortcuts which aid problem solving and decision making \[[1](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-heuristic-2795235)\]. The list presented in this book is inspired by the [Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) that was proposed by the Neilsen Norman Group in 1994. 

The qualities of PB described in this book can be considered as general guiding principles for participatory budgeting, as broad rules of thumb rather than specific guidelines for conducting PB which are available in the form of [toolkits](https://www.participatorybudgeting.org/run-pb/) like the one provided by Participatory Budgeting Project \(PBP\), New York or the detailed evaluation criteria suggested by other organisations such as the Center for Environment Education \(CEE\), Pune in their [critique](http://www.vikalpsangam.org/article/participatory-budgeting-in-pune-a-critical-review/#.XdvlCpMzYWo) of the PB conducted by Pune Municipal Corporation. 

The form of this book is also inspired by [Little Book of Design Research Ethics](https://www.ideo.com/post/the-little-book-of-design-research-ethics) produced by IDEO, a global design company.

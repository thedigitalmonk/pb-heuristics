# \#2 Transparency Of Process And Access To Information

At every stage of citizen participation in budget \(which is an ongoing and year-long process\) it is important to have information readily available in the public domain. It must be possible for citiznens to learn about how budgets work, their rights and how PB works. They should also be able to view the results of their vote, the charter of demands as it passes through various local governance bodies, the annotations and changes along the way and information about the implementation details and status of projects proposed by citizens.

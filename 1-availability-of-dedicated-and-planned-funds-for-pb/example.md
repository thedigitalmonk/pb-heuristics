## Case A

**Rating:** 1

## Case B

Another State Government ran a participatory budgeting campaign which allowed citizen inputs to decide how **40%** of the State revenue would be spent. This amount was also planned and included certain components like Womenâ€™s Component Plan \(around 10 percent\) which ensured that citizens from different groups of society were able to propose specific projects under those components.

**Rating**: 4.5

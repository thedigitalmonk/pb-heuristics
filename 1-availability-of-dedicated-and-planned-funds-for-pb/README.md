# \#1 Availability Of Dedicated And Planned Funds for PB

It is not possible to make 100% of the budget at any level of administration open for citizen participation given the complex nature of funding of development projects which involve the interests of different actors both internal and external to the body and its jurisdiction. Accountability increases when a dedicated pool of money is made available for deliberation by the local government body. A further level of commitment is demonstrated when the funds are divided into dedicated portions for various schemes and interest groups e.g. Women’s Component Plan in Kerala’s PB budget in 1996

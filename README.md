# What is PB?

Participatory budgeting \(PB\) is a democratic process in which community members decide how to spend part of a public budget. It started in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 1989. Over the years it has spread to over 3000 cities around the world and developed into a step by step process that ensures participation of citizens in budgets from states, counties, housing authorities, schools and other institutions. A quick introduction of the process can be found on [participatorybudgeting.org](https://www.participatorybudgeting.org/what-is-pb/)
